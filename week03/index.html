        <p>Here at Cam\CREATE, our in-house Lego enthusiast Cameron Lewis
            creates with Legos, and with a passion you've never seen. With
            a knack for capturing human emotion in Legos, Cam is able to
            capture what other artists can't. When Jimmy Fallon asked Cameron
            "Why Legos?" on <i>The Tonight Show</i> earlier this year,
            Cameron replied in a way that only Cameron would. "Legos give
            a distinctive plasticky and pixelated look to my work. And
            the Millennials love it. They're obsessed with my work like
            they're obsessed with Minecraft." </p>
        <p>
            Though Cameron has a flair for the dramatic as pictured in his signature
            works above, he also likes to reproduce famous works by the
            likes of Michelangelo, Da Vinci, and Rembrandt in Lego as well.
            Any artist whose name sounds hoighty-toighty or whose works
            are featured in million-dollar auctions are liable to Cameron's
            Lego treatment. "Basically the more famous the original artist
            is, the more, like, famouser I get when I redo their work in
            Lego. And besides, my work improves upon the originals. Now
            Mona Lisa is actually looking at something," Cam said to loud
            cheering at his exhibition last month at New York City's prestigious
            Museum of Modern Art.

            guy. Not Cameron Lewis. He definitely doesn't have these skills.
