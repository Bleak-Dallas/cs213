<h1>Gallery split up into "slideshow"</h1>

    The guidelines make it clear that it is wise to mirror how content is displayed
    in print when it is magazine-like or book-like in nature. Since the
    content here is actual pieces of artwork, which is normally viewed
    sequentially in books and magazines (and even museums) I thought it
    would be wise to place it sequentially, with "Previous" and "Next"
    links below each piece of art in the slideshow.

<h1>Each gallery page now has the main site heading</h1>
<p>
    "Landmarks"</br>
    <a href="http//webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/2-navigation.html">link</a>
</p>
<p>
    Having a landmark like the website name at the top of each page makes a
    big difference in terms of helping users orient themselves. At any
    given moment, it is important for users to understand where they are.

<h1>New navigation bar, page subheadings</h1>
<p>
    "Supporting Web Search Users"</br> <a href="http//webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/2-navigation.html">link</a>
    </br>

    In the link above, the guidelines helped me see the importance of providing
    a means of helping users understand what is going on when they randomly
    drop into a page from a web search. As a result of them not seeing
    my home page, not only have I included the site's name on each page
    (as stated above) but I've also created a new vertical navigation bar
    along the left side of the page. Users have come to expect that navigation
    tools are conventially present along the top or sides of their pages,
    so I've tried to accommodate that. I've also made it clear on each
    page of the gallery that Cameron of "cam/CREATE" created each of the
    pieces of artwork (actually Nathan Sawaya did, but...yeah).

<h1>Removed distracting/extraneous colors in favor of simplicity</h1>
<p>
    "Simplicity and consistency"</br>
    <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/3-interface-design.html">link</a>
</p>
<p>
    I removed the background colors behind each of the gallery items. To remain
    "on-brand" so to speak, with cam/CREATE's "signature" blue and yellow
    colors (with the occasional grey element) to make it clear to users that they're on my site <i>and</i> communicate greater consistency. As the guidelines state, "Users are not impressed with complexity that seems gratuitous".
