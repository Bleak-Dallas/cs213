                    <p>As I stated earlier, my name is Cameron Lewis. I'm
                        a 28 year old

                        Well, not quite yet. </p>
                    <p>I am attending BYU-Idaho online from Provo, where I
                        am currently living. I got my Associate's Degree
                        from BYU-Idaho, but then transferred to BYU in
                        Provo, where I began studying International Relations,
                        with a desire to be a social entrepreneur solving
                        humanitarian crises. I ultimately realized this
                        dream would be more easily realized with a more
                        specialized and technical skill-set, so I decided
                        upon doing Software Engineering. But it takes quite
                        a bit longer at BYU! So I transferred back to BYU-Idaho.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Though working in humanitarian capacity still interests
                        me, the idea of working in a research and development
                        division also seems appealing.</p>
                    <p>California is my home state, but I think I'll set up
                        camp in Seattle, WA in the coming years.
                    </p>
                    <p>My wife (Brittany) and I have been married for four
                        years, and each enjoy being married to the best
                        friend we've ever had. Sadly, we have no children
                        yet, but it's a desire we'd like to see fulfilled
                        soon.</p>
